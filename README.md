# lenet_keras_py3
This program is using Keras library and Python 3 to build a LeNet-5 model. The model is modified from the original model. It is added the dropout layer and using stochastic gradient decent with momentum as the optimizer.\n
It is using MNIST database for training and testing. It will use 60000 handwritten digit images to train the model. Then, using another 10000 images for the inference test. The test accuracy can achieve 99.55%.
